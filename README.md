# Tubby

Tubby is a simple Python-based command-line application that allows users to download YouTube videos and audio files. With Tubby, users can choose to download either the video or audio only versions of a YouTube video by entering the video's URL. The user can also select the desired resolution for the video download and specify a custom file name for the downloaded content. Tubby is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it an ideal tool for quickly downloading YouTube content for offline viewing or listening. This is the initial release of Tubby, version 0.1, and we hope to continue improving and expanding the features of the app in future updates
